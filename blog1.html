      <p>
       Before starting your journey in becoming  a Web Developer ,you must first know how the website works.
<br><br>When you type a web address into your browser,the browser goes to the DNS server,and finds real address of server that website lives on.
<br><br>The browser then sends an HTTP request to the server, the server if approves the request ,it sends resposnse in form of copy of the website to the client, this 
response is in form of HTML, CSS and Javascript and our browser interprets and displays it for us.
<br><br>So it's necessary to first learn basics of website building i.e. HTML, CSS and Javascript .

            </br>
            <<span>html</span>>
            </br>
            <<span>head</span>>
            </br>
            <<span>title</span>>Page Title<<span>/title</span>>
            </br>
            <<span>/head</span>>
            </br>
            <<span>body</span>>
            </br>
            <<span>h1</span>>This is a heading.<<span>/h1</span>>
            </br>
